<h2>About the Project</h2>

<p>The goal of the project was to create a website of our choice. We decided to create a site that allows gamers to upload their gaming clips and share it with a community.
New users are able to register and create their profile. Users are also able to upload their clips and select a tag to self identify the game the clips pertains to. The tags "supported" are Valorant,Fortnite, Minecraft, Apex, Modern Warfare 2 and Overwatch 2 
Users can also add a bio to their profile alongside their phone number and gametag.</p>

<p>The vision for this website is to create a space where gamers can share aonly video game clips and share to others. As a Video game person I would like to see a unique space for gamers to feel comfortable and confident to share their clips that bring joy and excitement to other fellow players.</p>
